# RN Client Placeholder

Initialize a React Native app here. Recommended:
- iPad/iPhone first (Expo or Bare RN)
- Enable Mac Catalyst (Xcode) in Stage 2
- For Windows Store, create a separate RN Windows app in `apps/rn-windows`

Make sure to consume shared packages via PNPM workspaces and TS path aliases.
